# Real-Time OS Security Event Logger 🚨🔒

Welcome to the **Real-Time OS Security Event Logger**! 🎉 This is a cool little project built with Python 🐍 to keep an eye on your Linux system’s security. It watches for sneaky stuff like failed login attempts, analyzes them, and shows you what’s up in a neat window—all in real time! Perfect for beginners like me (and you!) to dip our toes into coding, Linux, and security. Let’s dive in! 🌊

## What’s This All About? 🤔
Imagine you’re a security guard for your computer! 🛡️ This tool:
1. **Monitors**: Spies on `/var/log/auth.log` (Linux’s security diary) for failed logins.
2. **Analyzes**: Counts how many times someone messes up and flags anything fishy (like >3 tries—uh-oh!).
3. **Visualizes**: Pops up a window to show logs and screams “ALERT!” if trouble’s brewing.

It’s simple, hands-on, and a great way to learn Python and Linux basics. Built with love and a little help from Grok (xAI). 💡

## What You’ll Need 🛠️
Before we get started, here’s the gear you need:
- **Operating System**: Linux (I tested on Ubuntu 22.04—works like a charm! 🌟)
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher (it’s the magic behind the scenes 🎩)
- **Libraries**: `pandas` (for number-crunching) and `tkinter` (for the pretty window)
- **Superpowers**: Root access with `sudo` (to peek at secret logs 🔐)
- **Optional Fun**: SSH server (`openssh-server`) to fake some login fails for testing

## Setting It Up: Step-by-Step 🏃‍♂️
Don’t worry—I’ve got your back! Let’s set this up together. Open your terminal (`Ctrl+Alt+T`) and follow along:

1. **Install the Goodies** 🎁:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update                         # Freshen up your system
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-tk openssh-server -y  # Grab Python, pip, GUI stuff, and SSH
   pip3 install pandas                     # Add pandas for analysis
   sudo systemctl start ssh                # Wake up SSH for testing
   ```

2. **Get the Code** 📥:
   - **With Git** (if you’re feeling fancy):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-logger.git
     cd security-logger
     ```
   - **Manually**: Download the zip, unzip it, and `cd` into the folder.

3. **What’s Inside the Box?** 📦:
   ```
   security-logger/
   ├── logger.py          # The watcher 👀—grabs security events
   ├── analyzer.py        # The thinker 🧠—checks for trouble
   ├── interface.py       # The show-off 🎬—displays everything
   ├── security_logs.txt  # Where events hide (created when you run it)
   ├── README.md          # This guide you’re reading! 📖
   ```

## How to Use It 🚀
Ready to catch some bad guys? Here’s how to play:

1. **Start the Watcher** 👀:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 logger.py
   ```
   - **What’s Happening?**: It spies on `/var/log/auth.log` for “Failed password” lines and saves them to `security_logs.txt`.
   - **Stop It**: Hit `Ctrl+C` when you’re done.
   - **Why `sudo`?**: That log file is top-secret—only admins can peek!

2. **Watch Live** 📺:
   ```bash
   python3 interface.py
   ```
   - **What’s Happening?**: A window pops up showing logs, refreshing every 2 seconds. If >3 fails happen, a big red “ALERT” yells at you! 🚨
   - **Cool Factor**: Run this while `logger.py` is on to see action live!

3. **Dig Into the Details** 🕵️:
   ```bash
   python3 analyzer.py
   ```
   - **What’s Happening?**: Reads the logs, counts fails per user, and warns if someone’s up to no good (>3 attempts = trouble!).

4. **Make Some Noise** 🎤:
   - Open another terminal and try this:
     ```bash
     ssh wronguser@localhost
     ```
   - Type a wrong password a few times. Watch `logger.py` catch it and `interface.py` light up!

## What You’ll See: Examples 🌈
Here’s a sneak peek at what happens:

- **logger.py Output**:
  ```
  Monitoring started... Press Ctrl+C to stop.
  2025-03-22 14:30:45 - Suspicious: Mar 22 14:30:45 ubuntu sshd[1234]: Failed password for wronguser from 127.0.0.1 port 22 ssh2
  ```

- **analyzer.py Output**:
  ```
  Total failed attempts: 4
  Attempts by user:
  wronguser: 4
  ALERT: Possible attack on wronguser!
  ```

- **interface.py Output**: 
  - A window with logs scrolling and a red “ALERT: Too many failed attempts!” when things get spicy (after 4 fails).

## Troubleshooting: Don’t Panic! 😅
- **“Permission denied” on `logger.py`?** 
  - Fix: Use `sudo`—it’s a security thing! 🔑
- **No events showing up?**
  - Fix: Ensure SSH is on (`sudo systemctl start ssh`) and try more `ssh wronguser@localhost` attempts.
- **GUI not opening?**
  - Fix: Reinstall `tkinter`: `sudo apt install python3-tk -y`.
- **Still stuck?** 
  - Drop a note in the Issues tab (if on GitHub) or ask your friendly neighborhood coder! 🤝

## Cool Ideas for Later ✨
This is just the start! Here’s what we could add:
- **More Events**: Watch for file changes or weird processes. 📁
- **Better Storage**: Swap the text file for a database. 🗄️
- **Fancier GUI**: Add charts or buttons to make it pop! 📊

## Why This Rocks 🎸
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Python’s easy, and this project teaches you real stuff without overwhelming you.
- **Real-World Use**: Spotting failed logins is legit security work!
- **Fun to Show Off**: The GUI and alerts make it demo-ready for presentations. 🎤

## Credits 🙌
- Built by a newbie (me!) with big help from **Grok** at xAI—thanks for the wisdom! 🧠
- Inspired by a love for learning and a bit of curiosity about keeping systems safe. 💻

Happy coding, and enjoy catching those sneaky login fails! 🎉🔍
